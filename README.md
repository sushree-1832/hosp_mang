# React + Vite
The Hospital Management System (HMS) project was developed to enhance hospital operations by providing an efficient, secure, and user-friendly web-based platform. Built using ReactJS, Node.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS, the system supports role-based access for administrators, doctors, pathologists, and dispensary staff. Key features include patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical record handling, medicine inventory management, and diagnostic reporting. A chatbot integrated with ChatGPT provides disease-related information. The project, completed during a one-month internship at NALCO, emphasized agile development, secure authentication, and real-time data handling, significantly improving healthcare service efficiency and patient care.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
